## Abstract
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a fundamental model for 
studying cooperation and defection in game theory. 
This study evaluates the performance of the GRIM 
strategy in comparison to four other strategies: 
random, cooperate with probability, reactive, and 
zero-determinant 
(ZD). Through extensive 
simulation and analysis using histograms and 
cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), we 
demonstrate the long-term outcomes of each 
strategy. The results highlight that the GRIM 
strategy, while effective in maintaining cooperation 
when mutual trust is established, shows significant 
vulnerability to strategies that incorporate 
randomness or adaptive behaviours. Although 
GRIM can sustain cooperation, it is highly 
punitive, leading to mutual defection when trust is 
broken. This analysis underscores the importance 
of understanding the strengths and limitations of 
various strategies in repeated interactions, 
particularly in environments where cooperation is 
critical but cannot always be guaranteed.

## Conclusion
In this report we have conduct the tournament 
between various strategies particularly grim, 
random, prob, reactive and ZD strategy, we 
compare the grim with the other strategy and found 
out that grim performs well by giving the higher 
score. In conclusion, while the GRIM strategy 
excels in maintaining high average scores through 
consistent cooperation enforcement, it may be less 
adaptable in more complex environments where 
flexibility and forgiveness could yield better long
term outcomes. The analysis underscores the 
importance of strategy selection based on the 
specific dynamics of the game environment.
